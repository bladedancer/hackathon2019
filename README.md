Adapters encapsulate the logic necessary to interface Mixer with specific external infrastructure backends. A handler is a resource responsible for holding the configuration state needed by an adapter.

Instance configuration specifies the request mapping from attributes to adapter inputs. 

Rules specify when a particular handler is invoked with a specific instance.
